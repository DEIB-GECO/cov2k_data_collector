The 12-bp deletion sequence (26320–26331) , located at the TMD of E gene, which is responsible for E protein homo-oligomeric multimer formation and influences the ion channel activity of the E protein as a viroporin. The ion channel activity of E viroporin is important for viral replication and pathogenesis. Mutations at the TMD residues V25F and N15A could block the ion channel activity of the CoV E viroporin, while mutations close to V25F such as F26L or L27S could compensate for the loss of ion channel activity.

The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021.

This mutation was predicted to manifest as an in-frame deletion of 9 aa ΔFKVSIWNLD (SARS-CoV-2 p6Δ22-30). The function of p6 in SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully determined. However, based on its similarity to the SARS-CoV p6, it appears likely that it plays a role as an antagonist of interferon signaling, thus assisting in the viral suppression of the innate immune system.

Analysis of the original clinical sample indicates that the deletion was not present, while sequencing of subsequent passages of the strain identifies the deletion as a majority variant. This suggests that the deletion originated ab initio during passaging and subsequently propagated into the majority, possibly due to the removal of selective pressure through the IFN-deficient Vero E6 cell line. This deletion is predicted to cause a shift from N-endo to N-ecto in the transmembrane localization of the SARS-CoV-2 p6 Δ22-30 N-terminus, possibly leading to the ablation of its native function.

Experimental	The entire ORF7a and the original stop codon for ORF6 were lost. The latter resulted in an extension of the Orf6 protein by 2 amino acids. Furthermore, ORF7b was potentially extended in the 5′ direction by 27 nucleotides due to the occurrence of an in-frame start codon.

DRB3*02:02, DRB1*09:01, and DRB1*04:01, that do not allow binding of the wildtype, but accommodate the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 (L84S) variant. ORF8 L84S variant annuls binding to two MHC class II alleles that the wildtype virus allows: HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*02:01 and DRB1*15:01. DPA1 and DPB1 encode different amino acid residues in the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II alleles that determine which peptides can be presented to CD4+ T-cells. HLA-DPA1*01:03-DPB1*04:02 (but not DPB1*02:01) was associated with an increased risk of developing narcolepsy. Mutational effects analysis predicted that  mutations occurring in surface glycoprotein, ORF3a and ORF6 were predicted to alter the molecular consequences, including loss of sulfation in surface glycoprotein and loss of proteolytic cleavage in ORF3a and loss of allosteric site in ORF6. L84S mutation is found to decrease the stability of the protein with DDG value of -2.29 kcal/mol.

In conclusion, the ∆382 variant of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be associated with a milder infection. The observed clinical effects of deletions in ORF8 could have implications for the development of treatments and vaccines.##A comparison of subgenomic RNA reads predicted from the sequence data  suggests that Δ382 viruses may have altered levels of transcription compared to wild-type viruses, including those of the ORF6 and N genes which are known SARS-CoV interferon (IFN) antagonists, raising the possibility that infection with Δ382 viruses might result in an altered innate immune response.

The triple site mutation 28881-28883 that brings change in two amino acid 203-204:RG>KR, is known to play a critical role in virion assembly and structure. The mutated 203/204 region of N protein affects the SR (serine-arginine)-rich motif of the protein (a crucial region for controlling viral transcription and replication) by introducing lysin in between them that might hamper the phosphorylation at serine residue required for normal functioning of N protein. Significant reduction in pathogenicity has been observed with the deletion of SR domain, therefore it is important to target 203-204:RG>KR positions of the N protein to design the drugs for controlling the disease.

The triple site mutation 28881-28883 that brings change in two amino acid 203-204:RG>KR, is known to play a critical role in virion assembly and structure. The mutated 203/204 region of N protein affects the SR (serine-arginine)-rich motif of the protein (a crucial region for controlling viral transcription and replication) by introducing lysin in between them that might hamper the phosphorylation at serine residue required for normal functioning of N protein. Significant reduction in pathogenicity has been observed with the deletion of SR domain, therefore it is important to target 203-204:RG>KR positions of the N protein to design the drugs for controlling the disease.

A single SARS-CoV-1 amino acid change, Spike D480A/G in the receptor binding domain (RBD), arose in infected humans and civets and became the dominant variant among 2003/2004 viruses. D480A/G escapes neutralizing antibody 80R, and immune pressure from 80R in vitro could recapitulate emergence of the D480 mutation. Although there is no evidence yet of antigenic drift for SARS-CoV-2, with extended human-to-human transmission, SARS-CoV-2 could also acquire mutations with fitness advantages and immunological resistance. Attending to this risk now by identifying evolutionary transitions that may be relevant to the fitness or antigenic profile of the virus is important to ensure effectiveness of the vaccines and immunotherapeutic interventions as they advance to the clinic.

However, both of these mutants retained full sensitivity to C135. Eight anti-spike antibodies were tested against sixteen SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD variants. Variants were encoded into pVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S (mNeon) pseudoparticles and neutralization assays were performed in Vero cells. IC50(M) values are shown for each variant.

This position is proximal to the region where the S protein attaches itself to the viral membrane (figure 5). It is to be noted that the Gly at this position is conserved among the closely related coronaviruses (Bat coronavirus RaTG13 and HKU3, SARS-CoV) hinting toward its possible role in maintenance of structure and function of the S protein (figure 7). In general, as explained above, Gly backbone has higher conformational freedom than any other amino acid residues (Ramakrishnan and Ramachandran 1965). Therefore, substitution of Gly with Val would impart rigidity to the local region. The possible implication of such rigidity on the association of S protein with viral membrane could be understood from a structure of S protein in association with the viral membrane.

Structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike interacting with the human ACE2 from three recent X-ray structures, deposited on the Protein Data Bank: 6LZG, 6M0J  and 6VW1 were obtained. In the present study, Grid Based Pharmacophore Model (GBPM) has been applied to all selected complex models considering Spike and ACE2 either as host or guest. DRY, N1 and O GRID probes were considered for describing hydrophobic, hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor interaction. For each probe a cut-off, required for highlighting the most relevant MIFs points, was fixed above the 30% from the corresponding global minimum interaction energy value.	Mutation at position 477 could minimally modify the Spike-ACE2 recognition. GBPM Q2 classification suggested Serine (S) 477 as a weak contributor to the complex interaction. In all PDB entries selected, Serine 477 is located into a solvent exposed random coil loop. No interaction with ACE2 or Spike residues can be observed.

The mutated 203/204 region of N protein affects the SR (serine-arginine)-rich motif of the protein (a crucial region for controlling viral transcription and replication) by introducing lysin in between them that might hamper the phosphorylation at serine residue required for normal functioning of N protein.
